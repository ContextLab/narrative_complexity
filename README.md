A hackathon project initiated at [MIND 2019](https://mindsummerschool.org/current_year.html) at Dartmouth College.

Potential directions for the project
- Create a database of semantic content of movies that
    people might want to refer to in order to select
    an ideal stimulus space for functional alignment
- Analyze ISC across naturalistic datasets to assess
    whether narrative complexity is related to similarities
    in functional topography
- Use narrative complexity to predict ratings and gross 
    value of films
- Assess consistency of the narrative across different 
    segments of movies
- Compare consistency of movie content and critical reviews
